# Kaleidoscopic-Vision
My first 3D Unity game, still a work in progress.
 
MAIN CONCEPT:
Player has to go through several puzzles and earn coins.

PLATFORM:
PC/MAC - Maybe port the game to mobile.

Developer Logs:
#upload 1.0 to Github - Uploaded all assets? Still learning how to properly upload all files to Unity.
#upload 2.0 to Github - I did not correctly upload all the necessary assets but hopefully the new branch will have all the necessary files.
